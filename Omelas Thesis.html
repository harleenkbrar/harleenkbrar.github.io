    <h1>Omelas Thesis</h1>
    <p>Does the greater good justify the suffering or torture of a minority?</p>
    <br>
    <p>The author presents a seemingly perfect utopia built on the suffering of a small child, leading readers to question if it is justified for the greater good.</p>
    <br>
    <p>The Ones Who Walk Away from Omelas challenges readers to think about grey morality and the implications of choices that harm and benefit different groups of people.</p>
    <br>
    <p>The author shows a utopia built on the torture of a small child and those who cannot justify it so they simply walk away.</p>
    <br>
    <p>The author presents an exaggerated version of our world, how many beautiful things we partake in are results of the mistreatment of real people.</p>
    <br>
    <p>This story asks us to question our own morality, whether we accept the suffering of some for the happiness of most, or if we choose to walk away altogether.</p>
    <br>
    <p>This story parallels our real life. It shows how many corporations take advantage of marginalized groups of people and what we as consumers decide to do about it.</p>
    <br>
    <p>The Ones Who Walk Away from Omelas presents a moral dilemma. We question whether it is practical or fruitful to reject a practice that prioritized the greater good and accept something unfamiliar because of our morals.</p>
