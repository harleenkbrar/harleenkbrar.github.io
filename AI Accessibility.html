    <h3><center>AI Accessibility Theses</center></h2>
    <strong>The development of AI creates more opportunity for neurodivergent folks to succeed in their personal and professional lives.</strong>
    <br>
    <p>A lot of neurodivergent folks are able to keep up with their neurotypical peers much better through an app called InnerVoice, which helps them form a connection between text and reality.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Babies are able to understand facial expressions and mimic them by copying their parents, but neurodivergent children have trouble interpreting this so InnerVoice can help bridge this gap of understanding.</p>
    <br>
    <p>AI is also making analyzing text a lot more accessible by summarizing long paragraphs of writing so all people can understand it more easily.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Companies are realizing that burnout among neurodivergent folks is less, and that helps them in their professional success.</p>
    <br>
    <p>In order to create better working environments for neurodivergent folks, AI summarizes long texts, so they can apply their strong skill sets in their workplace without being hindered in other ways.</p>
    <br>
    <p>InnerVoice by iTherapy is transforming how neurodivergent children learn by helping them improve how well they understand and communicate with others.</p>
    <br>
    <p>By increasing accessibility in the workforce through AI, companies are recognizing the value of neurodivergent folks and are able to create a more inclusive environment as well.</p>
    <br>
    <p>New job opportunities have opened up to specifically neurodivergent folks due to their skill sets such as detail-orientation and innovation because of AI.</p>
    <br>
    <p>InnerVoice by iTherapy helps children create the correlation between real objects and the language to label them.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Through InnerVoice, AI-powered avatars help neurodivergent children visualize themselves speaking in order to bridge the gap between their communication and other children's.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Oftentimes, equitable learning environments do not exist for neurodivergent children, so AI is helping these children keep up with their neurotypical peers.</p>
    <br>
    <p>A lot of neurodivergent people excel in creating algorithms to complete certain tasks, the necessity of which is increasing because of the popularity of AI, so job opportunities are opening up for these folks.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Neurodivergent folks are disadvantaged in society when it comes to career opportunity and education because of the difference in how their brains are wired, and AI is emerging to create more equitable opportunities. </p>
    <br>
    <p>Many companies are now creating programs focused on hiring neurodivergent employees because of their skill sets and to foster a more inclusive workplace.</p>
